These are the examples that we considered during the development. Use the Main function from within the C_glutamicum/ or L_lactis/ folders to run the examples as:
Main(branch), where branch is a string for identifying the branch, e.g. one of the four branches 'resveratrol', 'pelargonidin', 'fisetin', 'quercetin'
The model for C. glutamicum is from [Zelle et al. 2015], for L. lactis [Flahaut et al. 2013].
