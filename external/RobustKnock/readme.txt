OptKnock and RobustKnock implementation based on the code from [Tepper and Shlomi (2009)]
The original version is available at http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~tomersh/methods.html
This version is independent from TOMLAB solver, but still depends on the COBRA 2.x toolbox [Schellenberger et al. (2011)] 
https://opencobra.github.io/cobratoolbox/ and the gurobi solver http://www.gurobi.com/
